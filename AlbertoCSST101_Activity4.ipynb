        "1. Non-monotonic reasoning is a type of reasoning where conclusions can be retracted or changed when new information is added. Unlike traditional logic, adding new premises might invalidate previously drawn conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Non-monotonic reasoning differs from monotonic reasoning in that in monotonic reasoning, adding new information never reduces the set of conclusions. Once a conclusion is derived monotonically, it remains true, regardless of any new evidence. In contrast, non-monotonic reasoning allows for conclusions to be withdrawn or revised when new, contradictory, or more specific information becomes available.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A real-life situation where a conclusion must change after new information is added is a medical diagnosis. For example, a doctor might initially conclude a patient has a common cold based on symptoms like a runny nose and cough. However, if new information like a positive flu test result becomes available, the initial conclusion (common cold) must be revised to influenza.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. A default rule is a rule that applies unless there is evidence to the contrary. It provides a plausible conclusion in the absence of complete information. For example, the default rule \"Birds can fly\" is a general assumption. This rule is applied unless we know the bird is a flightless exception like a penguin or an ostrich.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Argumentation frameworks help AI systems decide between conflicting rules by providing a structured way to represent and evaluate arguments for and against different conclusions. They allow systems to identify conflicts, determine which arguments are stronger (e.g., based on priority, specificity, or source reliability), and ultimately select a consistent set of conclusions that are justified by the available evidence and rules."

        "*   **User Input Handling:** The program successfully prompts the user for an animal name, converts the input to lowercase, and stores it for analysis.\n",
        "*   **Reasoning Logic Implementation:** The core logic effectively determines an animal's flight capability by first checking if it's a known bird. If so, it assumes flight, then checks against the `flightless_birds` set to revise the conclusion if an exception applies. If the animal is not a known bird, the program correctly states that flight capability cannot be determined based on the current knowledge.\n",
        "*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** The program generates a clear, step-by-step reasoning process for its conclusion, demonstrating logical deduction. For instance, if 'bird' (which is not in `known_birds`) is input, the program correctly states, \"The animal 'bird' is not in our list of known birds. We cannot determine if it can fly based on our current knowledge base.\"\n",
