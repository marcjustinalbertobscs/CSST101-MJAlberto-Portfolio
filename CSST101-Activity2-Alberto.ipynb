        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   For each of the three problems, specific predicates and constants were defined to represent the elements and relationships described in the statements.\n",
        "*   The English statements were successfully translated into their corresponding predicate logic formulas.\n",
        "*   A formal proof using natural deduction, involving steps like Universal Instantiation (UI) and Modus Ponens (MP), was constructed for each problem.\n",
        "*   All three stated conclusions were successfully derived and proven based on their respective premises.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The consistent application of predicate logic and natural deduction provides a robust method for formally verifying conclusions from a set of premises.\n",
        "*   This structured approach can be extended to analyze more complex logical arguments or to build automated reasoning systems.\n"
