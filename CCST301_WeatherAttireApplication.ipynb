        "Welcome to the Tropical Outfit Recommender — an interactive program designed to suggest appropriate clothing and accessories based on current weather conditions and temperature in tropical regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose**\n",
        "\n",
        "This program serves two main purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Practical Utility: It provides quick, weather-appropriate outfit suggestions to help users stay comfortable in varying tropical conditions such as sun, rain, wind, or cloud cover.\n",
        "2.   Educational Value: It demonstrates the use of propositional logic and expert system principles in decision-making. By using logical rules based on weather inputs, the program mimics how an expert system makes recommendations — allowing users to understand how condition-based logic can be implemented in real-world applications.\n",
